## Summary

The Android WebView shell has been implemented, built, and verified. The Capacitor
app now loads a real, functional React UI instead of blank/placeholder output.

### Build Status

| Step | Result |
|------|--------|
| `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` | ✅ Complete |
| `npm run typecheck` | ✅ 0 errors |
| `npm run android:webbuild` | ✅ Built in ~84s |
| `build/client/index.html` | ✅ Present |
| `npm run android:sync` (cap sync) | ✅ Synced to Android project |

---

## Architecture: Android Shell Build

The standard `npm run build` uses `remix vite:build` which requires a Cloudflare
Worker server context. On Android, there is no server — so a **separate SPA build
pipeline** was created:

```
android-index.html                    ← SPA HTML entry (no Remix, no SSR)
  └── /src/android-main.tsx           ← React root (MemoryRouter)
        └── ~/components/mobile/AndroidShell.tsx  ← Top-level shell
              ├── DndProvider (TouchBackend)
              ├── AndroidFallbackBanner (amber warning)
              ├── Chat tab → Chat.client.tsx (lazy)
              ├── Settings tab → AndroidSettingsPanel
              └── BottomNav (Chat | Settings)
```

Vite config: `vite.android.config.ts`
- No `remixVitePlugin` (no SSR, no server routes)
- `@vitejs/plugin-react` instead (pure CSR)
- Input: `android-index.html` → Output renamed to `build/client/index.html`
- `@remix-run/react` aliased to `src/shims/remix-react.tsx` (stub hooks)
- `@remix-run/cloudflare` aliased to `src/shims/remix-cloudflare.ts` (stub types)

npm scripts:
```json
"android:webbuild": "vite build --config vite.android.config.ts",
"android:sync":     "npm run android:webbuild && cap sync android",
"android:build":    "npm run android:sync && cap build android",
"build:remix":      "remix vite:build"
```

---

## New Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `vite.android.config.ts` | Android-specific Vite build config |
| `android-index.html` | SPA HTML entry point |
| `src/android-main.tsx` | React root with MemoryRouter |
| `src/shims/remix-react.tsx` | `@remix-run/react` stub hooks |
| `src/shims/remix-cloudflare.ts` | `@remix-run/cloudflare` stub types |
| `app/components/mobile/AndroidShell.tsx` | Top-level Android UI shell |
| `app/components/mobile/AndroidSettingsPanel.tsx` | Android settings panel |
| `app/styles/android.css` | Android-specific CSS |

---

## Previous Components (still verified present)

### 1. IndexedDB Persistence Adapter ✅
**File**: `app/lib/persistence/androidFallbackStorage.ts` (213 lines)

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `isIndexedDBAvailable()` | ✅ |
| `openDb()` — DB: `bolt-android-fallback` v1 | ✅ |
| `loadAndroidFallbackState()` | ✅ |
| `saveAndroidFallbackWorkspace()` | ✅ |
| `updateAndroidFallbackSession()` | ✅ |
| `resetAndroidFallbackStorage()` | ✅ |
| `getAndroidFallbackPersistenceStatus()` | ✅ |

### 2. Files Store Integration ✅
**File**: `app/lib/stores/files.ts`

- `#isFallbackMode` — set when `!isWebContainerSupported() || isCapacitor()`
- `#hydrateFallbackState()` — loads IndexedDB on startup
- `#persistFallbackState()` — saves to IndexedDB on every file change
- All CRUD operations (create/write/delete) trigger persistence

### 3. Workbench Store Integration ✅
**File**: `app/lib/stores/workbench.ts`

- `resetLocalAndroidWorkspace()` — clears files + IndexedDB + editor state
- `updateAndroidFallbackSession()` — called on file open + view change

### 4. Runtime UI — "Saved locally on Android" ✅
**File**: `app/components/@settings/tabs/runtime/RuntimeModeTab.tsx`

- `getAndroidFallbackPersistenceStatus()` polled on mount
- "Saved locally on Android" / "No local Android workspace yet" badge
- Reset button (Android-only)

## Build Output

```
build/client/
├── index.html          ← Capacitor entry (renamed from android-index.html)
├── assets/
│   ├── android-entry-*.js      (main bundle ~1.2 MB, gzip 340 kB)
│   ├── Chat.client-*.js        (chat lazy chunk ~3.1 MB, gzip 908 kB)
│   ├── [130+ language/syntax chunks]
│   └── [CSS, icons, media]
```

Total build time: ~84 seconds.
Warnings: some chunks > 500 kB (expected — Chat.client is large; lazy-loading already applied).

---

## Capacitor Sync

```
cap sync android
→ Copies build/client/ to android/app/src/main/assets/public/
→ Updates native plugin registrations
→ Android project ready for Android Studio / Gradle build
```

---

## TypeScript

`npm run typecheck` → **0 errors** ✅

Shims created to satisfy TypeScript for Android-only build artifacts:
- `src/shims/remix-react.tsx` — stubs for `useSearchParams`, `useNavigate`, `useLocation`, `Link`, `Outlet`, etc.
- `src/shims/remix-cloudflare.ts` — stubs for `json`, `redirect`, type aliases

---

---

## Android Fallback UX Polishing

To provide a seamless experience on mobile where WebContainer features (like shell execution and live dev server) are unavailable, a polished fallback layer was added:

### 1. Terminal Fallback
- Replaces the blank/unresponsive xterm terminal tabs with a designed fallback view.
- Explains: *"Terminal Unavailable: Interactive terminals require a WebContainer environment or a Remote Runtime connection."*
- Features a **"Configure Remote Runtime"** button that programmatically navigates the user to the Settings tab in the Android app.

### 2. Live Preview Fallback & Static HTML Preview
- Detects whether an `index.html` file exists in the local workspace.
- If present, allows a **"Run Basic Static Preview"** which reads the file in-memory and renders it inside the preview pane iframe via a local `Blob` URL.
- Shows a warning banner: *"⚠️ Local Static Preview: Viewing in-memory index.html. External dependencies and scripts with relative paths may not load."*
- If no `index.html` is found, explains that Live Server Preview requires a WebContainer/Remote Runtime and prompts configuring one in settings.

### 3. Action Runner Interceptor
- Intercepts all unsupported commands/actions (`shell`, `build`, `start`, `supabase`) in `action-runner.ts` on Android and marks them failed gracefully with: `"Command execution requires WebContainer or Remote Runtime"`.
- Displays a non-blocking toast warning (`toast.warning(...)`) instead of silent failures or application crashes.

---

## APK Compilation & Web Preview

- **Debug APK Location**: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- **Gradle Compilation**: Succeeded in 2m 1s via automated Gradle wrapper with JVM 21 auto-detection.
- **Local Web Preview**:
  - Dev server: `npm run android:dev` (exposed on Wi-Fi: `npm run android:dev:host`)
  - Production build preview: `npm run android:webpreview` (exposed on Wi-Fi: `npm run android:webpreview:host`)

---

## Phase 5: Remote Runtime Design & Scaffold

- **Specification**: Created `docs/REMOTE_RUNTIME.md` detailing the secure API contract and WS streams protocol.
- **Client SDK**: Implemented `app/lib/remote-runtime/RemoteRuntimeClient.ts` to manage workspace sync, health status tests, single-file writes, and WebSocket connections.
- **Settings UI**: Connected Android Settings tab to trigger live GET `/health` calls (Test Connection) and POST `/workspace` calls (Create Workspace) with real-time connection state indicators (`disconnected` / `checking` / `connected` / `failed`) and detailed error rendering.

## Phase 5.3 Audit: Remote Runtime File Sync MVP

### Present Files

| File | State |
|------|-------|
| `app/lib/remote-runtime/RemoteRuntimeClient.ts` | Present; extended with typed list/read/write/sync responses and clearer HTTP/network errors |
| `app/lib/remote-runtime/RemoteWorkspaceSync.ts` | Added in this run |
| `app/lib/persistence/androidFallbackStorage.ts` | Present; used as the local source of truth for sync |
| `app/components/mobile/AndroidSettingsPanel.tsx` | Present; extended with file-sync controls/status |
| `app/components/@settings/tabs/runtime/RuntimeModeTab.tsx` | Present; extended with Remote Runtime token/workspace fields and file-sync controls/status |
| `remote-runtime/src/server.ts` | Present; extended file API while keeping command execution stubbed for Phase 5.3; superseded by Phase 5.4 command-profile endpoints |
| `remote-runtime/src/files.ts` | Present; extended safe path resolution, metadata, text-only reads/writes |
| `docs/REMOTE_RUNTIME.md` | Present; updated for file-sync MVP and LAN setup |
| `README_ANDROID.md` | Present; updated with Remote Runtime sync usage |
| `CURRENT_STATUS.md` | Present; updated with Phase 5.3 status |
| `TODO_NEXT.md` | Present; updated with Phase 5.3 completion checklist |

### Missing Files

No required Phase 5.3 file remains missing. `RemoteWorkspaceSync.ts` was missing at the start of this run and is now present.

### Partially Implemented Pieces Found

- `RemoteRuntimeClient.ts` existed with health/workspace/list/sync/write methods, but list/sync were loosely typed and errors only exposed raw status codes.
- `remote-runtime/src/files.ts` had an uncommitted helper for reading workspace files, but it was incomplete for the MVP API shape and needed text-safety/path-boundary hardening.
- `remote-runtime/src/server.ts` had an uncommitted import for that helper, but no content-list/read endpoint behavior was wired yet.
- Android settings had Remote Runtime URL/token/workspace creation controls, but no push/pull/current-file sync actions or sync status display.
- Runtime Mode tab still described the remote backend as future-only.

### Exact Changes Made In This Run

- Added `RemoteWorkspaceSync.ts` with `pushLocalWorkspaceToRemote()`, `pullRemoteWorkspaceToLocal()`, `syncSingleFileToRemote()`, `getSyncStatus()`, and `resetSyncStatus()`.
- Kept IndexedDB fallback storage as the local source of truth; pull keeps local files on conflict and records conflict details.
- Added binary/non-text skip warnings and synced/skipped/conflict/error status fields.
- Strengthened `RemoteRuntimeClient.ts` with typed file metadata, `readFile()`, typed `syncFiles()`, and clearer 401/403/404/500/network errors.
- Hardened the remote file API for nested directories, path traversal, JSON errors, text-only payloads, metadata responses, `includeContent=true`, and single-file reads.
- Left command execution as a stub for Phase 5.3; Phase 5.4 later replaced the stub with safe allowlisted command profiles.
- Added Remote Runtime file-sync controls/status to Android Settings and Runtime Mode UI.
- Updated Remote Runtime docs, Android guide, current status, TODO list, and this audit.

---

## Phase 5.4: Safe Remote Command Execution MVP

### Implemented

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| Command profiles | Added `remote-runtime/src/commands.ts` with allowlisted profiles only: `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `pnpm install`, `pnpm run dev`, `pnpm run build` |
| Start command API | Implemented `POST /workspace/:id/commands` accepting `commandProfile` only |
| Command status API | Implemented `GET /workspace/:id/commands/:commandId` |
| Stop command API | Implemented `POST /workspace/:id/commands/:commandId/stop` with process-tree termination on Windows |
| Execution safety | Requires auth, validates workspace, runs with `cwd` set to workspace path, uses fixed profile arguments, enforces timeout, and logs start/end/error |
| WebSocket output | Streams `status`, `stdout`, `stderr`, and `exit` events to authenticated workspace WebSocket clients |
| Free-form input | WebSocket input is ignored with an `input_ignored` status message |
| Client SDK | Updated `RemoteRuntimeClient` with command profile types, `runCommand()`, `getCommandStatus()`, `stopCommand()`, and authenticated WebSocket URL |
| Android terminal fallback | Shows Remote Runtime command buttons/output/stop control when configured; otherwise shows setup instructions |
| Command status panel | Added last profile, command ID, status, last output timestamp, and exit code display in the Remote Runtime terminal panel |
| Docs | Updated `docs/REMOTE_RUNTIME.md`, `README_ANDROID.md`, `CURRENT_STATUS.md`, `TODO_NEXT.md`, and this report |

### Verification In This Run

| Command / Check | Result |
|-----------------|--------|
| `npm run typecheck` | ✅ Passed |
| `npm --prefix remote-runtime run build` | ✅ Passed |
| Remote command API smoke | ✅ Passed; `npm run build` streamed `build-ok`, `npm run dev` stopped successfully, invalid profile rejected with HTTP 400 |
| `npm run android:webbuild` | ✅ Passed; existing Vite/UnoCSS warnings only |
| `npm run android:sync` | ✅ Passed; Capacitor sync completed |

### Phase 5.4 UI + Integration Audit

| Area | Result |
|------|--------|
| `remote-runtime/src/commands.ts` | Present; allowlisted profiles only, fixed arguments, workspace `cwd`, timeout, stop/process-tree termination |
| `remote-runtime/src/server.ts` | Present; auth-protected start/status/stop endpoints, workspace checks, WebSocket output/status streaming |
| `RemoteRuntimeClient.ts` | Present; typed command profile methods and authenticated WebSocket URL |
| Android settings | Present; Remote Runtime URL/token/workspace controls and corrected command-profile wording |
| Terminal fallback | Present; command buttons, output stream, stop control, missing-config guidance; completed with command history/status panel |
| Preview fallback | Present; remains static-preview focused and does not expose command input |

### Server-Side Safety Audit

| Requirement | Verified State |
|-------------|----------------|
| No arbitrary shell input | ✅ `POST /commands` accepts `commandProfile` only; WebSocket input is ignored |
| Allowlisted profiles only | ✅ `isCommandProfile()` gates the six npm/pnpm profiles |
| Token required | ✅ Command routes use `requireAuth`; WebSocket upgrade uses `validateToken()` |
| Workspace-only execution | ✅ Workspace ID is validated, existence is checked, and command `cwd` is the resolved workspace path |
| Timeout and stop | ✅ `REMOTE_RUNTIME_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_MS` is enforced and stop endpoint terminates the running command |
| Event streaming | ✅ stdout/stderr/status/exit events are broadcast to authenticated workspace WebSocket clients |

### Exact Changes Made In This Run

- Audited the existing Phase 5.4 command server, client, terminal fallback, Android settings, and docs instead of rebuilding them.
- Added a Remote Runtime command status panel showing last command profile, command ID, status, last output timestamp, and exit code.
- Updated command event handling so stdout/stderr/status/exit events keep the status panel current.
- Corrected stale Android settings copy that still said command execution was disabled.
- Updated docs/status files for the UI integration verification pass.

### Verification In This Run

| Command / Check | Result |
|-----------------|--------|
| `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` | ✅ Passed; existing Node engine warnings and 54 npm audit findings reported |
| `npm run typecheck` | ✅ Passed |
| `npm run android:webbuild` | ✅ Passed; existing Vite/UnoCSS/icon/chunk warnings only |
| `npm run android:sync` | ✅ Passed; Capacitor sync completed |
| `npm --prefix remote-runtime install` | ✅ Passed; remote-runtime audit reported 0 vulnerabilities |
| `npm --prefix remote-runtime run build` | ✅ Passed |

## Phase 5.5: Remote Runtime Live Preview Status

### Implemented

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| Preview state tracking | Added per-workspace preview status: `none`, `starting`, `running`, `failed` |
| Dev command integration | Observes safe `npm run dev` and `pnpm run dev` command events without adding arbitrary command input |
| URL detection | Detects common Vite-style URLs from stdout/stderr, including `localhost`, LAN IPs, and `0.0.0.0` |
| Preview metadata | Stores port, local URL, network URL, last detection time, and command ID |
| Preview API | Replaced stub `GET /workspace/:id/preview` HTML with JSON status and added `/workspace/:id/preview-page` HTML fallback |
| Client SDK | Updated `RemoteRuntimeClient.getPreviewUrl()` to call the real JSON endpoint with typed preview status |
| Android preview UI | Added remote preview refresh/status card, direct preview iframe loading, and external-open control |
| Proxy decision | No unsafe preview proxy was added; Android uses direct detected network URLs |
| LAN guidance | Updated docs to require `REMOTE_RUNTIME_HOST=0.0.0.0` and Vite `--host 0.0.0.0` for phone access |

### Audit Notes

| File | Result |
|------|--------|
| `remote-runtime/src/server.ts` | Preview endpoint was a stub; now returns JSON status and safe HTML fallback |
| `remote-runtime/src/commands.ts` | Existing command event stream reused; no new command surface added |
| `remote-runtime/src/preview.ts` | Added in this run for preview state and output URL detection |
| `RemoteRuntimeClient.ts` | Existing stub method completed with typed REST call |
| `Preview.tsx` | Existing static fallback extended with Remote Runtime live preview status and iframe loading |
| Docs/status files | Updated for direct LAN preview behavior and no-proxy limitation |

### Exact Changes Made In This Run

- Added `remote-runtime/src/preview.ts` to observe safe dev-command output and maintain per-workspace preview metadata.
- Updated `remote-runtime/src/server.ts` so command events update preview state before WebSocket broadcast.
- Implemented JSON `GET /workspace/:id/preview` and safe HTML `GET /workspace/:id/preview-page`.
- Updated Android `Preview.tsx` to refresh Remote Runtime preview status, render direct LAN preview URLs, and expose an external-open button.
- Updated Remote Runtime docs, Android guide, current status, TODO list, and this report.

### Verification In This Run

| Command / Check | Result |
|-----------------|--------|
| `npm run typecheck` | ✅ Passed |
| `npm run android:webbuild` | ✅ Passed; existing Vite/UnoCSS/icon/chunk warnings only |
| `npm run android:sync` | ✅ Passed; Capacitor sync completed |
| `npm --prefix remote-runtime run build` | ✅ Passed |

## Phase 5.6: Android LLM API Bridge Design & Scaffold

### Implemented

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| API route audit | Audited `api.chat.ts`, `api.llmcall.ts`, `api.models.ts`, `api.enhancer.ts`, provider key handling, and streaming behavior |
| Architecture decision | Recommended a separate authenticated Cloudflare/Vercel-style API backend as the MVP |
| Security boundary | Documented that provider keys must stay on the backend and must not be bundled into Android client JS/APK assets |
| Design doc | Added `docs/ANDROID_LLM_API_BRIDGE.md` with problem statement, security requirements, API contract, auth model, streaming design, and Android UX |
| Client scaffold | Added `app/lib/android-api/AndroidApiClient.ts` with `listModels()`, `sendChatMessage()`, `streamChatResponse()`, `enhancePrompt()`, and `validateProviderConfig()` |
| Settings placeholder | Added Android Settings card for Android API Backend URL, backend auth token, health test, and provider-key warning |
| Production chat | Intentionally not connected yet; this phase is design/scaffold only |

### Audit Notes

| Area | Result |
|------|--------|
| `api.chat.ts` | Streams AI SDK data-stream chunks and annotations, performs context selection/summaries, and depends on server-only LLM helpers |
| `api.llmcall.ts` | Supports text streaming or JSON generation, validates model/provider, and uses server-side provider instances |
| `api.models.ts` | Returns provider metadata and static/dynamic model lists, with dynamic models potentially requiring provider credentials |
| `api.enhancer.ts` | Streams enhanced prompt output from server-side provider calls |
| Provider keys | Existing web route behavior can read cookie keys and server env; Android MVP must avoid client-side provider keys entirely |

### Exact Changes Made In This Run

- Created the manual-trigger GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/android-debug-apk.yml` to compile `app-debug.apk` and upload it.
- Added comprehensive "How to Build APK from GitHub" guide and "Android Unknown-Source Warning" explanation to `README_ANDROID.md`.
- Added detailed troubleshooting sections in `README_ANDROID.md` for Gradle execution permissions, Android SDK paths, Node/Vite memory allocation limits, and missing artifacts.
- Verified TypeScript compiler checks and Capacitor build/sync operations locally.

### Verification In This Run

| Command / Check | Result |
|-----------------|--------|
| `npm run typecheck` | ✅ PASS (0 errors) |
| `npm run android:webbuild` | ✅ PASS (built in 29s) |
| `npm run android:sync` | ✅ PASS (synced in 0.7s) |
